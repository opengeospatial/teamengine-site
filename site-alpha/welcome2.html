<p>This free "self-service" testing facility can be used by any developer as often as they like to test their implementations of OGC standards. You don't need to be an OGC member, and you will always have unlimited access to this testing facility.</p>

<p>There are more than 40 adopted OGC standards, but we currently can only certify implementations for the tests listed bellow. New tests currently under development can be seen and tried out at our <a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/">beta testing facility</a>. We encourage you to try them out and provide feedback, so that we may finalize them and make them oficial.</p>

<p>Once your product passes the test getting it certified is easy. Visit the <a href=â€ http://www.opengeospatial.org/complianceâ€> OGC Compliance web page</a> for more details. If you need help passing the test contact the contact the <a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/forum" target="_blank">CITE forum</a> </p>

<p>We have a need for new tests and for reference implementations. If you want to contribute a reference implementation or you want to develop OGC tests, please contact the Director of the Compliance Program, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/organization/staff/lbermudez">Luis Bermudez.</a></p>
